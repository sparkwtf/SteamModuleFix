As of **January 1, 2026**, Steam officially stopped supporting **32-bit Windows**.  
Because of that, many **Steam modules** used in various cracks no longer work with modern Steam builds.

This repository contains the **source code** for a **64-bit SteamModule DLL**, created to restore compatibility with **64-bit Steam** for various **cracks** that relied on the old 32-bit SteamModule.
